# Vanilla blog cards

## Introduction

As part of a technical assessment, I reproduced a given design of three blog posts in cards.

![Provided design to reproduce](/public/design.png)

The requirements were to use the [Vanilla framework](vanillaframework.io/docs), and to pull the data from the [WordPress API](https://people.canonical.com/~anthonydillon/wp-json/wp/v2/posts.json).

## Technologies used

- The cards are built in a simple **React** app with **Typescript**
- The styling uses Canonical's **Vanilla** framework and **SASS**.
- The project was deployed using **Github Pages**.
